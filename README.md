I finished this project by the beginning of May.

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data.

### Description
In this project, Python is used to analyze bike share data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The project involves importing datasets, computing descriptive statistics, and building an interactive terminal-based script to explore and present insights about bike-sharing trends.

### Files used
/_chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv/_

### Changes III
The Last version is the final one - I hope.
